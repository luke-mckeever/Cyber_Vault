# PSAA (Practical Security Analyst Associate)

## Guidelines

>The exam will assess a student’s ability to use analysis tools, interpret artefacts, and apply investigation methodologies to evaluate security incidents and retrace attacks.

- **2 Days To Complete Assessment**
	- 4 Tickets Allotted 
- **2 Days to Complete the Report**

You need to make report on each ticket, but ultimately only 1 pdf containing all 4 reports should be submitted.

A pdf will be provided which has detailed step by step instruction on how to do literally everything before you start you analysis.

Choose any of the 4 tickets and work on them first

Once you start a scenario or ticket, try not to jump to a different one if you cant solve some questions.

## Exam Format

- Practical Hands On
- Real-World Security Alerts
- Focus on monitoring, detecting, analysing, and responding to threats.
- briefed on a number of security scenarios based on user reports, alerts, or system and network artefacts.
- You will need to investigate, identify indicators of compromise, and analyse activity across multiple systems and endpoints

## Report Structure

> Expected to produce a detailed, professional report detailing the steps you took during your investigation, the tools you used, and the findings you uncovered.

- Document your findings and address the incident questions outlined within each ticket.
- Your report should be structured in a clear, concise, and professional format.
- You will be provided with a report template to work off of as soon as you start your exam.

### Points To Document:
1. The incident summary
2. The investigation or executive summary
3. Detailed answers to the proposed incident questions, including evidence and screenshots
4. A list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) pertinent to the incident
5. Any reactive or proactive recommendations pertinent to responding to the incident

> TIP: If you’re done with 2 incidents in the first 8 hours like me, make your report at that very moment. Since you wont get access to labs after the first two days.
