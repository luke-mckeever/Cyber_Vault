## üîç Locard's Exchange Principle üåü

> "Every contact leaves a trace." üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Locard's Exchange Principle, conceptualized by Dr. Edmond Locard, underpins digital forensics by asserting that interactions between systems, devices, or users leave traces. These traces include logs, metadata, digital fingerprints, and artefacts such as deleted files or unauthorized access logs. By meticulously analysing these digital remnants, investigators can link cybercriminals to breaches, uncover unauthorized activities, and reconstruct events. This principle reinforces the importance of detailed data collection and analysis, ensuring accurate attribution and robust evidence in digital investigations.

## Important Forensic Artefacts üéÅ

#### config Files üóÉÔ∏è
**Folder location**: "*C:Windows/System32/config*"

##### **BBI (Boot Boot Integrity)**:  
Stores boot configuration settings. It helps forensic investigators analyze changes to the boot process or identify tampering aimed at compromising system integrity.

##### **BCD-Template (Boot Configuration Data Template)**:  
Contains a template for creating the Boot Configuration Data (BCD). Forensic analysis can reveal attempts to manipulate boot options or introduce malicious entries.

##### **COMPONENTS**:  
Part of the Windows Component-Based Servicing (CBS) store. This file tracks installed system components and updates. Investigators can use it to identify tampered or unauthorized updates.
 
##### **DEFAULT**:  
A registry hive that stores default user profile settings. Useful for determining the system's initial configuration and default behavior before user-specific modifications.
  
##### **DRIVERS**:  
Contains information about device drivers loaded during boot. Forensic investigators can use it to detect malicious or unauthorized drivers that could be used for persistence or privilege escalation.
  
##### **ELAM (Early Launch Anti-Malware)**:  
Stores configurations for anti-malware solutions that start early in the boot process. Investigators can check for tampering that disables or weakens security measures.
  
##### **SAM (Security Account Manager)**:  
Stores user account and credential information, such as hashed passwords. It is critical for analyzing user accounts, unauthorized access, or privilege escalation attempts.
  
##### **SECURITY**:  
Contains system security policies and local security authority settings. Forensic investigators use it to analyze access controls, audit policies, and potential tampering with security configurations.
  
##### **SOFTWARE**:  
A registry hive containing information about installed software, settings, and system policies. It helps identify installed programs, user preferences, and potentially malicious software.

##### **SYSTEM**:  
Stores system-wide configuration data, including services, drivers, and hardware profiles. Forensic investigators analyze it to detect changes to system configurations, malicious drivers, or service persistence mechanisms.
