# üîç Locard's Exchange Principle üåü

> "Every contact leaves a trace." üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Locard's Exchange Principle, conceptualized by Dr. Edmond Locard, underpins digital forensics by asserting that interactions between systems, devices, or users leave traces. These traces include logs, metadata, digital fingerprints, and artefacts such as deleted files or unauthorized access logs. By meticulously analysing these digital remnants, investigators can link cybercriminals to breaches, uncover unauthorized activities, and reconstruct events. This principle reinforces the importance of detailed data collection and analysis, ensuring accurate attribution and robust evidence in digital investigations.
