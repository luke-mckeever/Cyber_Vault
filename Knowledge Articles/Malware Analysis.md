# Malware Analysis

## Intro

#### Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behaviour, origin, and impact. 

> N.B. Safety is the most important aspect, as improper handling can lead to infections or data breaches. 
> It is crucial for identifying threats, developing defences, and improving incident response, helping cybersecurity professionals protect systems and data from attacks.

### Appropriate Malware Handling

The most vulnerable time during any malware analysis is when malware is in transit.
moving malware from one machine to another can be dangerous and may pose the risk of accidental detonation. 
There are a number of steps that can be taken to reduce this risk as prevention of not possible

1. Changing the File Type extension - changing a windows executable (.exe) to something inert like ".thisisnotmalware" can ensure that detonating this will not result in an infection
2. Ensure all malware samples are contained within an Archived Zipped file and also password protect these Zip File - (Standard Password: infected )
