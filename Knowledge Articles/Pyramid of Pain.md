# The Pyramid of Pain

## 🛡️ Understanding the Pyramid of Pain Framework

The **Pyramid of Pain** is a cybersecurity model introduced by David J. Bianco to illustrate the difficulty of detecting and defending against various Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). Each layer of the pyramid represents a type of IOC, increasing in both complexity and effectiveness when used to thwart adversaries.

| **Layer**       | **Description**                                                | **Examples**                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **TTPs**        | Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. High impact for defense. | Spear-phishing, privilege escalation |
| **Tools**       | Specific tools adversaries use.                               | Mimikatz, Metasploit                 |
| **Network Artifacts** | Data generated by malicious activity on the network.         | IPs, HTTP requests                   |
| **Domain Names**| Adversary-controlled domains.                                  | Malicious C2 domains                 |
| **IP Addresses**| IPs associated with threat actors.                             | 192.168.1.1 (malicious endpoint)     |
| **Hash Values** | File hashes identifying malware or tools.                      | MD5, SHA256                          |

### 🧩 **Why the Pyramid of Pain Matters**

The Pyramid of Pain is designed to:

- **🎯 Highlight Effective Detection**: Prioritize high-value IOCs for maximum impact.
- **🚀 Challenge Adversaries**: Increasing their operational cost with robust defenses.
- **🧠 Enable Proactive Responses**: Understanding adversary behavior for future-proof strategies.
