# ðŸ”ºCIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that represents the three core principles of information security: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. 

- **Confidentiality** ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and protected from unauthorized disclosure.

- **Integrity** guarantees that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered unless modified in an authorized manner.

- **Availability** ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users. 

Together, these three principles guide the design and implementation of security controls to protect digital assets from various threats.
