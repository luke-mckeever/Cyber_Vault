# ðŸ”ºCIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a foundational model in cybersecurity that represents the three core principles of information security: **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**. 

- **Confidentiality** ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and protected from unauthorized disclosure.

- **Integrity** guarantees that data remains accurate, consistent, and unaltered unless modified in an authorized manner.

- **Availability** ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed by authorized users. 

Together, these three principles guide the design and implementation of security controls to protect digital assets from various threats.

# ðŸ”ºAAA Triad
The **AAA Triad** in cybersecurity stands for **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**, and it defines a framework for controlling access to resources and tracking user activity. 

- **Authentication** verifies the identity of a user or system, typically through credentials like passwords, biometrics, or tokens. 

- **Authorization** determines what actions or resources an authenticated user is permitted to access, based on their role or permissions. 

- **Accounting** (or auditing) involves tracking user activity and resource usage to maintain logs, support audits, and detect anomalies. 

Together, AAA ensures secure and accountable access control across networks and systems.
