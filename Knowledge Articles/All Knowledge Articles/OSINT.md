### What is OSINT?
>*OSINT, or Open-Source Intelligence**, is the process of collecting, analysing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to gain strategic insights and answer specific questions. It involves gathering data from websites, social media, news outlets, public records, forums, and other open sources without engaging in illegal or unethical activities.*

## THE ONE ABOVE ALL
[OSINT FRAMEWORK](https://osintframework.com/) this is the most utilised resource on this page, it is a full broken down framework on how to identify specific details or data points on an individual

---

## Sock Puppets
> ***sock puppets are fake online identities** used to gather information and conduct investigations while maintaining the investigator's real identity and privacy. These accounts help researchers access restricted content, perform discreet reconnaissance, and protect their personal and professional lives by separating them from their work*

While preforming OSINT it's good practice to use a SOC puppet, this will ensure complete anonymity and allow for realistic results.

---

### Best Practice for Sock Puppet Accounts 
- Do not associate the account to your own real identity
- Add history to the accounts  (adding followers, creating posts, adding images & generating a footprint)
  Breakdown of best practices here: https://web.archive.org/web/20210125191016/https://jakecreps.com/2018/11/02/sock-puppets/

## Google Dorking
Use Google‚Äôs advanced search operators to discover publicly exposed information, misconfigurations, or sensitive data during OSINT or security assessments.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | 
|   site:          |  Restrict results to a domain        |  `site:example.com`       | 
|   filetype:      |  Search for specific file extensions |  `filetype:pdf`           |
|   intitle:       |  Find keywords in page titles        |  `intitle:"index of"`     |
|   inurl:         |  Match keywords in URL               |  `inurl:admin`            |
|   intext:        |  Match keywords in html body         |  `intext: password`       |

## Image OSINT

### Reverse Image Lookup

Reverse image searching is the practice of taking an image and using search engines to find where it has appeared online, identify its origin, verify authenticity, or discover related content such as older versions, higher resolutions, or connected profiles.

##### Key Resources
- [**Google Images / Google Lens**](https://images.google.com/) ‚Üí Broad coverage, quick general matches.
- [**Yandex**](https://yandex.com/t) ‚Üí Strong facial and object recognition, often finds matches others miss.
- [**TinEye**](https://tineye.com/) ‚Üí Excellent for historical tracking and identifying when/where an image first appeared.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Results can vary, false matches are common, and regional differences exist‚Äîalways verify manually.

### Image Metadata 

Image metadata refers to hidden information stored within image files, such as the camera model, date/time of capture, GPS coordinates, and software used. Analysts use metadata to verify authenticity, trace origins, and sometimes geolocate where a photo was taken.

##### Key Resources

- [**Jimpl.com**](https://Jimpl.com) ‚Üí An online service for quick, browser-based metadata extraction without installing software.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Metadata can be removed (stripped) or tampered with, so findings should always be cross-checked with other OSINT methods.

### Physical Location

Physical location OSINT is the process of gathering intelligence about a target‚Äôs real-world environment before an engagement. The goal is to identify entry points, building layouts, security controls, and surrounding terrain that may impact physical or cyber-physical penetration testing.

##### Key Resources
