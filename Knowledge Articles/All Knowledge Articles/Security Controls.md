## Types of Security Controls 

### Preventive
Used to prevent or block access.
E.g. Firewall Rules, Policies, Guard Shacks, Door Locks

### Deterrent

E.g. Splash Screens, Threats, Reception Desks, Warning Signs

### Detective 
Used to identify, log and store events relating to the access attempt
E.g. System Logs, Login Reports, Property patrol, Motion detectors

### Corrective 
Used to apply a control after an event has been detected or taken place 
E.g. Restoring from backup, Creating post action policies, Contacting law enforcement, Fire extinguisher usage 

### Compensating
Used to apply a security control using other means sometimes temporarily 
E.g.  Firewall blocks an application temporarily, using a generator after an outage

### Directive 
Used to instruct or direct a subject towards security compliance
E.g. Training, Instruction Signage, Creating compliance policies
