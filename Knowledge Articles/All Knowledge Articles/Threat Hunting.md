# 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Hunting Knowledge Article

#KA #BLUE 

Welcome to the **Threat Hunting Knowledge Article**! This page is dedicated to providing a **deep-dive explanation** of what threat hunting is, why it matters, and how it’s carried out in modern cybersecurity operations. If you’re looking to elevate your SOC, DFIR, or Red/Blue Team capabilities — you’re in the right place! 🚀

## 📖 What is Threat Hunting?

**Threat Hunting** is the **proactive process of searching for threats** that have evaded traditional security defenses such as firewalls, SIEM alerts, antivirus, and EDR solutions. Unlike reactive measures that respond to alerts, threat hunting focuses on **actively seeking out adversaries** within an environment before they cause significant damage.

> In simple terms: **It’s looking for the hacker who’s already inside.**

🔑 **Core Principles of Threat Hunting:**
- **Proactive, not reactive** → Hunters don’t wait for alerts, they create hypotheses and investigate.
- **Intelligence-driven** → Guided by TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) such as those from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Continuous improvement** → Every hunt sharpens detection rules, enriches SIEM/EDR logic, and strengthens defenses.
- **Human + Machine** → Combining analyst expertise with advanced analytics, threat intel feeds, and automated tools.

## 🎯 Why Threat Hunting is Important

- **Detect stealthy attacks** that bypass security tools 🛡️
- **Reduce dwell time** of adversaries before they exfiltrate data 📉
- **Enhance detection engineering** by improving alert rules 🔧
- **Boost SOC maturity** from reactive monitoring to proactive defense 🚀
- **Understand adversary behavior** through threat intelligence mapping 🕵️‍♀️

## 🔍 Structured vs Unstructured Threat Hunting

Threat hunting can generally be broken into **two primary methodologies**:

### 📌 Structured Hunt
A **structured hunt** is based on known intelligence or frameworks.

- **Foundation**: Guided by hypotheses, known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), or TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Example**: Hunting for persistence mechanisms after learning about a recent APT campaign.
- **Tools Used**: SIEM queries, EDR telemetry, log correlation, threat intel feeds.
- **Advantages**: Efficient, measurable, and aligned with known adversary tactics.
- **Best For**: Environments seeking targeted hunts based on intelligence.

⚙️ **Workflow:**
1. Define Hypothesis (e.g., *“An adversary is using PowerShell for lateral movement”*)
2. Build Queries / Detection Rules
3. Investigate & Validate
4. Document Findings & Update Detections

---

### 📌 Unstructured Hunt
An **unstructured hunt** is more exploratory, relying on analyst intuition and anomaly detection.

- **Foundation**: Begins without specific intelligence, focusing instead on unusual behaviors.
- **Example**: Reviewing unusual spikes in outbound traffic or suspicious service creations.
- **Tools Used**: Baseline analysis, anomaly detection tools, behavioral analytics, raw log review.
- **Advantages**: Can uncover novel attack techniques not yet documented.
- **Best For**: Identifying **unknown unknowns** — new or sophisticated attacker behaviors.

⚙️ **Workflow:**
1. Establish Baselines (normal user/machine behavior)
2. Identify Anomalies
3. Deep Dive Analysis
4. Create Detection Logic for Future Incidents
