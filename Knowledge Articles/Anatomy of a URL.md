## What is a URL? 🤔
A **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** is the address of a resource on the internet. Think of it as the digital equivalent of your home address, guiding users to websites, documents, images, or other content.

## Breakdown of a URL 🛠️

Below is a detailed breakdown of its components:
