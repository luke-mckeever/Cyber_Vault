# The Cyber Kill Chain 🔒🖥️
#KA #CTI 

Welcome to **The Cyber Kill Chain** GitHub Page! 🚀 Dive deep into the mechanics of the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain** framework and how it helps combat cyber threats.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The Cyber Kill Chain, developed by Lockheed Martin, is a conceptual framework that outlines the phases of a cyberattack. It helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond effectively to malicious activities.

> **"By understanding the steps attackers take, we can better protect our assets."**

### 1️⃣ **Reconnaissance**
- **Goal:** Gather information about the target.
- **Techniques:**
  - Passive monitoring (e.g., OSINT 🌐)
  - Scanning tools like Nmap 🛡️

### 2️⃣ **Weaponization**
- **Goal:** Craft malicious payloads.
- **Techniques:**
  - Exploit kits 🧰
  - Malware creation 🤖

### 3️⃣ **Delivery**
- **Goal:** Transmit the payload to the target.
- **Techniques:**
  - Phishing emails 📧
  - Drive-by downloads 📂

### 4️⃣ **Exploitation**
- **Goal:** Execute malicious code.
- **Techniques:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities 🛠️
  - Social engineering 🧠

### 5️⃣ **Installation**
- **Goal:** Install malware on the target system.
- **Techniques:**
  - Backdoors 🚪
  - Trojans 🐴

### 6️⃣ **Command and Control (C2)**
- **Goal:** Establish a channel to control the compromised system.
- **Techniques:**
  - C2 servers 📡
  - Encrypted tunnels 🔐

### 7️⃣ **Actions on Objectives**
- **Goal:** Achieve the attacker's end goal (e.g., data exfiltration, disruption).
- **Techniques:**
  - Data theft 💾
  - Ransomware attacks 💣
