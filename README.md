## Tags 

In Obsidian, the tagging system allows users to categorize and link their notes by adding hashtags to any part of their text. For example, tagging a note with `#project` makes it easy to find all notes related to "project" simply by clicking on the tag or searching for it in the search bar. Tags help organize and connect ideas efficiently within your personal knowledge base.
