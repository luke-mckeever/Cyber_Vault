## üîç Key Use Cases for Sysmon Monitoring

1. **Process Monitoring**: Use Event IDs 1, 5, and 25 to track process creation, termination, and tampering activities.
2. **Network Monitoring**: Leverage Event ID 3 to detect unauthorized or suspicious network connections.
3. **Registry Monitoring**: Event IDs 12‚Äì14 are crucial for identifying changes to critical registry keys and values.
4. **File Integrity**: Monitor file creation, deletion, and alternate data streams with Event IDs 2, 11, 15, and 23.
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Detect elevated or unauthorized executions using Event IDs 28 and 29.

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Tuning**: Customize your Sysmon configuration to reduce noise and focus on relevant events.
- **Correlation**: Use Event ID combinations to detect multi-step attacks (e.g., DLL injection followed by network activity).
- **Log Forwarding**: Forward Sysmon logs to SIEM tools like Splunk or ELK for centralized analysis.

Mastering Sysmon Event IDs enables you to build a robust monitoring system and strengthen your defense strategies. üöÄ
