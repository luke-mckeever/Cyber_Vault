## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Filters**: In the Event Viewer, apply filters to narrow down specific Event IDs for faster analysis.
2. **Centralized Logging**: Use tools like Splunk or Elastic Stack to centralize and visualize event logs.
3. **Correlate Events**: Combine multiple Event IDs to detect complex attack patterns (e.g., failed logons followed by account lockouts).

Stay vigilant and use these Event Codes to strengthen your cybersecurity defenses! üöÄ
