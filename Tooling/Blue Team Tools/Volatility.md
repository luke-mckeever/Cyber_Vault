## üß∞ Common Commands

Below are some essential commands that can be used with Volatility to perform various forensic analyses:

> The flag `-h` can be applied to all below command modules for a further guidance
> Replace OS with the specified operating system the memory dump originated from e.g. `windows`, `mac` or `linux`

##### Memory Info Dump
This will provide a high level overview of the OS and architecture used within the memory dump file

```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.info
```
---

#### Network Memory Analysis

##### Network Statistics
- This will dump all known network Statistics within the memory dump
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.netstat
```

##### Network Scan
- This will identify all known network connections within the memory dump
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.netscan
```
---

#### Process Memory Analysis

##### List Processes 
- This will list all running processes on the machine at the time the memory dump was taken
> N.B. Use `| grep <INSERT TERM>` or `less` as the output is usually quite large 
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.pslist
```

##### List (Specific) Processes 
- This will return the specific process details from the memory dump with specified Process ID (PID) from the memory dump
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.pslist --pid <PID>
```

##### Process Scan
- This will scan for all executed processes on the system at the time of the memory dump
> N.B. Use `| grep <INSERT TERM>` or `less` as the output is usually quite large 
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.psscan
```

##### Process Tree
- This will list all running processes on the machine at the time the memory dump was taken in the form of a tree diagram utilising `*` as the branches
> N.B. Use `| grep <INSERT TERM>` or `less` as the output is usually quite large 
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.pstree
```

##### Command line Process Execution
- This will list all command line arguments that executed a process
> N.B. Use `| grep <INSERT TERM>` or `less` as the output is usually quite large 
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.cmdline
```

##### Dump Running Process Executable
- This will dump the specified process as a dump or `.dmp` file to the specified output location
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> -o <OUTPUT LOCATION> <OS>.pslist --pid <PID> --dump
```

##### DLL Imports
- This will provide a list of all Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL's) imported by a specified process
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> -o <OUTPUT LOCATION> <OS>.dlllist --pid <PID>
```

#### Registry Memory Analysis

##### Registry Memory
- This will provide the list of registry hives that were obtained at the time of the memory dump
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem>  <OS>.registry.registry.hivelist
```

##### Userassist Registry 
- This will provide the registry for the user assist registry key, this will display all processes executed by the user within the memory dump
- > N.B. Use `| grep <INSERT TERM>` or `less` as the output is usually quite large 
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem>  <OS>.registry.userassist
```

##### Dump Registry Hive 
- This will dump the filtered registry key as a dump or `.dmp` file to the specified output location for further analysis
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> -o <OUTPUT LOCATION> <OS>.registry.hivelist --filter "<PARAMETER>" --dump
```

##### Registry Key Contents 
- This will provide the contents of the specified registry key that was obtained during the memory dump
```bash
python3 vol.py -f <FILENAME.vmem> <OS>.registry.printkey --key "<PATH OF REGISTRY KEY>"
```
